Pet Health Online is a web application that allows you to view your pet's health records and vaccination due dates. Using MERN stack, I developed a seamless application that allows users to create an account that, upon login, will link to the medical health record database and display their pets. 
With each pet, the database will retrieve their health records and display the data. Users can interact with the site by adding their pet's photo, built with Multer.
